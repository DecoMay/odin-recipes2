        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This beef satay recipe is the main course-size version of a fabulous Thai appetizer: strips of beef marinated in Asian spices, skewered, and grilled for a truly amazing combination of flavors. With grilling season still in full swing, you can never have enough new and exciting ways to enjoy beef. Serve with my peanut dipping sauce.</p>
